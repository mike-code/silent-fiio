# Silent FiiO

The app was created to mitigate a known issue [[1]](https://www.reddit.com/r/FiiO/comments/mtjg3g/strange_click_sound_with_fiio_k3/) [[2]](https://www.reddit.com/r/headphones/comments/ba83p2/fiio_k3_disable_auto_off_aka_it_clicks_every_time/) [[3]](https://www.reddit.com/r/FiiO/comments/v0cblh/fiio_k3_popping_when_no_audio_played_fixed_on_mac/) with FiiO DAC which is put to sleep when no sound is played. This not only cuts off ~1s every time you start an audio, but also has an irritating "click" sound on macOS 10+.

This app merely hooks to your default system speaker, preventing FiiO to go into sleep mode even though it doesn't play any sound.
